Non-linear optics involves the study of the interaction of light within non-linear media. Since all media are fundamentally non-linear to a certain degree, the study of non-linear optics is an important area of research. An important application of the study of non-linear optics is in the description of light during its propagation through optical fibers. The propagation of light through an optical fibre is described by Maxwell's equations and by considering the Polarization vector $\textbf{P}$ as a non-linear equation of the electric field $\textbf{E}$, which allows you to rewrite the Electromagnetic Wave equation to incorporate the non-linear behaviour. This can then be reduced to a form equivalent to the well known non-linear Schrodinger equation, the solution of which constitutes the focus of this project. Numerical analysis using the split step method and RK4 to solve the non-linear Schrodinger equation were used to confirm the existence of the so called soliton solutions, which retain their shape and velocity during propagation, and are known to obey the non-linear Schrodinger equation. We also numerically confirmed the existence of forces between neighbouring solitons that lead to their relative attraction in an oscillatory nature.
